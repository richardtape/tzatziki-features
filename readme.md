## Behat feature tests

This repo is a collection of Behat tests for sites that can run on a server set up as per https://github.com/richardtape/selenium-firefox-chrome-behat-ubuntu-16.04

With the appropriate github hooks, this repo can be updated and the tests can then be immediately available on the testing server and can then be run.
